## Marking Sections as "Read"

To help you keep track of your progress when reading the Django documentation using the "BetterDjangoDocs" extension, we've added a convenient feature. You can easily mark a section as "read" by following these steps:

1. As you scroll through a section in the documentation, you'll find the "Done" button at the bottom of each section.

2. When you've finished reading and understanding the content in that section, simply click the "Done" button.

By clicking the "Done" button, you can keep track of the sections you've already reviewed. This feature is designed to enhance your experience when navigating through the documentation, making it easier to manage your progress and avoid redundancy.

## Marking Sections as Doubt

Within the "BetterDjangoDocs" extension, we've implemented a feature that allows you to mark a section as a doubt. Here's how it works:

- While hovering over the "Done" button, you will notice a question mark icon.
- Clicking this question mark icon will indicate that you have a doubt or question about the section you're currently viewing in the Django documentation.

This feature is designed to help you keep track of sections that you find confusing or need further clarification. It can be a useful tool for improving the documentation and collaborating with others to address questions or concerns.
